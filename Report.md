# Project 1

---

This Notebook and the generated pdf report are my implementation of the first Udacity project.

You will find comments per cell block and comments along the code to explain the implementation. As suggested by Udacity, you can already use their provided code for DQN and their neural network implementation. Simple adjustments are then made to adapt this code to work with implementation for Unity ml-agent as their initial code is done for Gym environments.

Have fun reading through the code and results. I have solved the environment within 514 Episodes only while the requirement is below 1800 Episodes. Future plans are discussed at the end of the report.

# Navigation

---

In this notebook, you will learn how to use the Unity ML-Agents environment for the first project of the [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893).

### 1. Start the Environment

We begin by importing some necessary packages.  If the code cell below returns an error, please revisit the project instructions to double-check that you have installed [Unity ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation.md) and [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/).


```python
from unityagents import UnityEnvironment
import numpy as np
```

Next, we will start the environment!  **_Before running the code cell below_**, change the `file_name` parameter to match the location of the Unity environment that you downloaded.

- **Mac**: `"path/to/Banana.app"`
- **Windows** (x86): `"path/to/Banana_Windows_x86/Banana.exe"`
- **Windows** (x86_64): `"path/to/Banana_Windows_x86_64/Banana.exe"`
- **Linux** (x86): `"path/to/Banana_Linux/Banana.x86"`
- **Linux** (x86_64): `"path/to/Banana_Linux/Banana.x86_64"`
- **Linux** (x86, headless): `"path/to/Banana_Linux_NoVis/Banana.x86"`
- **Linux** (x86_64, headless): `"path/to/Banana_Linux_NoVis/Banana.x86_64"`

For instance, if you are using a Mac, then you downloaded `Banana.app`.  If this file is in the same folder as the notebook, then the line below should appear as follows:
```
env = UnityEnvironment(file_name="Banana.app")
```


```python
env = UnityEnvironment(file_name="Banana_Windows_x86_64/Banana.exe")
```

    INFO:unityagents:
    'Academy' started successfully!
    Unity Academy name: Academy
            Number of Brains: 1
            Number of External Brains : 1
            Lesson number : 0

Environments contain **_brains_** which are responsible for deciding the actions of their associated agents. Here we check for the first brain available, and set it as the default brain we will be controlling from Python.


```python
# get the default brain
brain_name = env.brain_names[0]
brain = env.brains[brain_name]
```

### 2. Examine the State and Action Spaces

The simulation contains a single agent that navigates a large environment.  At each time step, it has four actions at its disposal:
- `0` - walk forward 
- `1` - walk backward
- `2` - turn left
- `3` - turn right

The state space has `37` dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  A reward of `+1` is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of `-1` is provided for collecting a blue banana. 

Run the code cell below to print some information about the environment.


```python
# reset the environment
env_info = env.reset(train_mode=True)[brain_name]

# number of agents in the environment
print('Number of agents:', len(env_info.agents))

# number of actions
action_size = brain.vector_action_space_size
print('Number of actions:', action_size)

# examine the state space 
state = env_info.vector_observations[0]
print('States look like:', state)
state_size = len(state)
print('States have length:', state_size)
```

    Number of agents: 1
    Number of actions: 4
    States look like: [1.         0.         0.         0.         0.84408134 0.
     0.         1.         0.         0.0748472  0.         1.
     0.         0.         0.25755    1.         0.         0.
     0.         0.74177343 0.         1.         0.         0.
     0.25854847 0.         0.         1.         0.         0.09355672
     0.         1.         0.         0.         0.31969345 0.
     0.        ]
    States have length: 37
    

### 3. Take Random Actions in the Environment

In the next code cell, you will learn how to use the Python API to control the agent and receive feedback from the environment.

Once this cell is executed, you will watch the agent's performance, if it selects an action (uniformly) at random with each time step.  A window should pop up that allows you to observe the agent, as it moves through the environment.  

Of course, as part of the project, you'll have to change the code so that the agent is able to use its experience to gradually choose better actions when interacting with the environment!


```python
env_info = env.reset(train_mode=False)[brain_name] # reset the environment
state = env_info.vector_observations[0]            # get the current state
score = 0                                          # initialize the score
while True:
    action = np.random.randint(action_size)        # select an action
    env_info = env.step(action)[brain_name]        # send the action to the environment
    next_state = env_info.vector_observations[0]   # get the next state
    reward = env_info.rewards[0]                   # get the reward
    done = env_info.local_done[0]                  # see if episode has finished
    score += reward                                # update the score
    state = next_state                             # roll over the state to next time step
    if done:                                       # exit loop if episode finished
        break
    
print("Score: {}".format(score))
```

    Score: 0.0
    

When finished, you can close the environment.


```python
# don't close the environment in the middle as you will need to restart the kernel
# env.close()
```

### 4. It's Your Turn!

Now it's your turn to train your own agent to solve the environment!  When training the environment, set `train_mode=True`, so that the line for resetting the environment looks like the following:
```python
env_info = env.reset(train_mode=True)[brain_name]
```


```python
#import the necessary libraries from Udacity's DQN implementation

import random
import torch
import numpy as np
from collections import deque
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
```

### Pay attention here

In the following cell, Udacity's DQN implementation is called, it is automatically calling QNetwork from the model.py file. QNetwork is a simple Fully connected network consisting of three linear layers followed by relu activation functions. all hidden layer sizes are 64. A more sophisticated network could enhance the function approximation part of the DQN architecture, but it is not needed now as the performance is way better than the specified baseline. That is left for future work.


```python
from dqn_agent import Agent

# load the same agent from Udacity's DQN with this env state and action sizes
agent = Agent(state_size=37, action_size=4, seed=15320)
```


```python
def dqn(n_episodes=2000, max_t=1000, eps_start=1.0, eps_end=0.01, eps_decay=0.995):
    """Deep Q-Learning.

    scores = []                        # list containing scores from each episode
    scores_window = deque(maxlen=100)  # last 100 scores
    eps = eps_start                    # initialize epsilon
    for i_episode in range(1, n_episodes+1):
        
        # resetting the environment for each episode and getting the initial state
        env_info = env.reset(train_mode=True)[brain_name]

        for t in range(max_t):

            action = agent.act(state, eps).astype(int)     # select an action based on current state, note that action has to be casted as int32 because np.argmax output is int64

            state = next_state                             # roll over the state to next time step

                break 
        scores_window.append(score)       # save most recent score
        scores.append(score)              # save most recent score
        eps = max(eps_end, eps_decay*eps) # decrease epsilon
        print('\rEpisode {}\tAverage Score: {:.2f}'.format(i_episode, np.mean(scores_window)), end="")
        if i_episode % 100 == 0:
            print('\rEpisode {}\tAverage Score: {:.2f}'.format(i_episode, np.mean(scores_window)))
        if np.mean(scores_window)>=13.0:
            print('\nEnvironment solved in {:d} episodes!\tAverage Score: {:.2f}'.format(i_episode-100, np.mean(scores_window)))
            torch.save(agent.qnetwork_local.state_dict(), 'checkpoint.pth')
            break
    return scores

### Future work

#### The below are ideas for future work suggested by Udacity:


Implement a double DQN, a dueling DQN, and/or prioritized experience replay!
For an extra challenge after passing this project, try to train an agent from raw pixels! Check out (Optional) Challenge: Learning from Pixels in the classroom for more details.

#### Other future work 

Implement Imitation learning techniques using demonstrations from the user such as GAIL (Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning) (https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03476) and Behavior Cloning (https://smartlabai.medium.com/a-brief-overview-of-imitation-learning-8a8a75c44a9c). Both are techniques that are adopted by recent Unity ml-agent versions.
